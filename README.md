`pytorch/examples` is a repository showcasing examples of using [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch). The goal is to have curated, short, few/no dependencies _high quality_ examples that are substantially different from each other that can be emulated in your existing work.

- For tutorials: https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials
- For changes to pytorch.org: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch.github.io
- For a general model hub: https://pytorch.org/hub/ or https://huggingface.co/models
- For recipes on how to run PyTorch in production: https://github.com/facebookresearch/recipes
- For general Q&A and support: https://discuss.pytorch.org/

## Available models

- [Image classification (MNIST) using Convnets](./mnist/README.md)

Additionally, a list of good examples hosted in their own repositories:

- [Neural Machine Translation using sequence-to-sequence RNN with attention (OpenNMT)](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py)
